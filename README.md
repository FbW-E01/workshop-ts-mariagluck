# Workshop-TS // Four things and then three more

1. Read this first: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html
2. IF you are interested in more TS and very confident with JS already
    - Read the whole TS handbook... 
    - ...or at least as much as you feel like your brain can take - really heavy text
    - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html
3. Learning more about and reviewing our core tools is always worth it, for example:
    - Git
    - VSCode
    - JavaScript fundamentals
    - Learn how to learn, find tips and tricks, and research yourself
4. Follow this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGymN8aFsv4
    - After you are done, explore https://www.omdbapi.com and build something with that using your own backend as a proxy
    - *NOTE* I did not test the API, so... yeah.
5. Examine your computer setup; how do you organize projects and tools. Is it working for you? Which projects do you keep on your computer and why?
6. Examine your git account; go through what projects do you have there
7. **BONUS** Dive deeper into JavaScript: Research what is the event loop
